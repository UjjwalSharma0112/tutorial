## Things to keep note of 

- Identifying patterns across DSA problems, not just memorising codes
- Learning to think about edge cases before they hit you in tests
- Optimising every operation, not stopping after “it works”

- Getting DBMS basics clear: how data is stored, indexed, queried and kept consistent
- Knowing in CN how data moves across networks, latency, bandwidth and real life issues
- Understanding in OS how processes, threads, memory and scheduling really work

- Doing proper LLD: breaking features, designing clean APIs, classes and interactions
- Understanding OOPs and using it in real projects, not only in exams
